## Datathon Project: Sales prediction for a bakery 🥖✨ 

## Overview
This repository contains a notebook developed for a challenge at CodeSpace Academy based on predicting sales for a famous bakery in Málaga incorporating exogenous variables from the Meteostat API to improve forecasting accuracy.

## Objective
The objective is to build a predictive model from scratch that forecasts daily sales using original data and deciding whether certain weather variables are relevant for the model. In addition to that, an exploratory analysis has been developed in order to uncover patterns that can influence sales.

## Methodology
1. Data collection: 📡 using the Meteostat API and merging in with a sales dataframe.
2. Exploratory analysis: 📊 creating plots.
3. Data preprocessing: 🧹 cleaning data and working with missing values. 
4. Model development: 🤖 selecting the best-performing model based on metrics. 
5. Evaluation: 🧮 using MAE, MSE and other relevant metrics.
